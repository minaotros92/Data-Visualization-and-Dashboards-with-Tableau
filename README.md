# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
- Examine the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset from 2015 to assess its financial implications.
- Generate informative visualizations using Tableau, highlighting crucial data points.
- Identify any recurring patterns and trends associated with wildlife strikes.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to address inquiries concerning the dataset.

## Process
1- Analyzing the dataset
2- Discovering potential inquiries addressable with the provided data
3- Constructing visual representations highlighting essential information
4- Examining correlations between strikes and wildlife incidents
5- Developing a dashboard
## Results

The initial task involved choosing a subject for this project, and the chosen option was the second option, focusing on the topic of "FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015."

The inquiries developed based on the accessible data were as follows:
1- Which are the states with higher incidences?
2- The animal species with the highest impact and associated expenses ?
3- What are the expenses associated with these strikes in each state?
4- What are the expenses associated with collisions over time and in future predictions?
5- Incident frequency varies at different times of the day?
6- What the Strikes Effect on Flights ?
